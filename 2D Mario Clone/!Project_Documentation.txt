Project Description:	
	2D Mario Side Scrolling Game. Control Mario as he makes his way through pre-configured levels in a quest to
	aquire the kidnapped Princess Peach. Fighting King Koopa's army of turtles, demon mushrooms, squids, flying fish
	and a variety of other nasty enemies.
	

Learning Objectives:
	Develop a solid Player Character control system 
	Create and understand Camera controls and how to use those
	Create and design a graphic based HUD system
	Create several different pickup item/powerups for the player to collect and modify player abilities
	Create environmental Objects for the player to interact with (foundations, smash blocks, animated flag pole...)
	Create enemy character with pathing and AI

Production Time:
	Setup	10mins
	Level	2 hours
	Assets	2 hours
	Player	2 hours
	Enemy	4 hours
	Menus	40mins
	GUI	30mins
	Build	10mins
	Review	10mins

High Concept:
	A 2d Side Scroller where the player character advances from Left to Right on pre-designed Level layouts
	Powerups such as mushrooms and fire flowers will aid the player along the way, but obstacles such as enemies
	and environmental will impede their progression

Controls:
	Arrow keys move the player ship Left to Right
	Down Arrow will Crouch the player allowing for side movement-assisted access to smaller areas
	Space makes the player jump (subject to keyDown period length. longer hold access higher jump)
	Shift-Hold sets the players speed threshold higher thus allowing for greater jumping distance
	in conjunction with Space
	'F' key (input could change) will access a fireball power if the player has the appropriate powerup (flower-mode)
	

Mocking Assest:
	Player (small & large)
	Enemy Gomba and turtle
	Fireball
	Blocks
	Pipes
	fireworks

(Note: Each asset will need support files suc as materials, audio, scripts etc.
	These will be discussed during production.)

TODO:
	Enable 360 controller compatability
	flag pole animation
	End Level animation (walk into castle while music plays + fireworks)
